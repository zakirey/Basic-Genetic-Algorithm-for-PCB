# Basic-Genetic-Algorithm-for-PCB

GA solution for PCB implemented for my AI & Knowledge Engineering course.

Algorithm was done in visual studio C# using WPF framework to create desktop application to see results and to manipulate several parameters like population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, number of iterations and tournament size.

Note: Algorithm has both Roullete wheel and Tournament selection, to switch between them the section of the code need to be uncommented in GeneticAlgorithmEngine.cs
